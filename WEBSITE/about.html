      <p>San Diego, California's largest city, is situated on the Pacific Ocean in San Diego Bay, just north of Mexico's international border and 120 miles south of Los Angeles. The city is divided into two halves, one of which stretches to the north-east of San Diego Bay and the other of which stretches to the south-east from the bay to the Mexican border. San Diego is the second most populous city in California, after Los Angeles, with a population of 1.54 million.</p>

         <h2>Foundation</h2>
        <p >The location was originally seen by a European named Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo from Spain. Cabrillo led a journey around the California coast in 1542, and set off from La Navidad, Mexico, in June of the same year. Cabrillo arrived in San Diego Bay in September and moored. However, the tale of San Diego begins in 1769, when the Spanish established a line of missions across California, followed by Mexico's independence in 1821 and the United States of America's acquisition of California in 1846.</p>

         <h2>Early 19th century</h2>
        <p>In 1850 San Diego only had a population of about 500 and was incorporated. San Diego grew slowly, with the construction of the Colorado House in 1851, the old Point Loma Lighthouse in 1855, and the Whaley House in 1856. It was California's first two-story brick house. San Diego was still a little town in the 1860s, but it grew quickly, eventually becoming a town with a population of 2300. Around the year 1870, a number of notable structures were built and opened, including the Llewelyn Building, Villa Montezuna, Yuma Building, and the Louis Bank of Commerce.</p>


          <h2>20th Century</h2>
        <p> Around the 20th century  San Diego became a major US naval base. However on July 1905 a boiler explosion occured and the incident led to the death of 66 men and many others had injuries .In 1915 San Diego held the Panama-California Exposition and the California-Pacific International Exposition in 1936.On this century ,the population of San Diego increased ,by 1940 it was 203 000.Meanwhile in 1948, the Maritime Museum was founded and a new public library was built, followed by the Timken Museum of Art which was opened in 1965.The San Diego Coronado Bay Bridge opened in 1969.</p>


          <h2>21st Century</h2>
        <p>San Diego continued to grow, and by 1970, it had a population of 696, 000 people. As the years passed, more advancements were made. In the twenty-first century, more and more developments occurred, and the population rose as well; in 2017, San Diego's population was 1.4 million. Tourism and defense are the city's main industries. San Diego is now the second largest city in California, with a population of over one million people.</p>
